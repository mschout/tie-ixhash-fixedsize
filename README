NAME
    Tie::IxHash::FixedSize - Tie::IxHash with a fixed maximum size

SYNOPSIS
      use Tie::IxHash::FixedSize;

      tie my %h, 'Tie::IxHash::FixedSize', {size => 3},
        one   => 1,
        two   => 2,
        three => 3;

      print join ' ', keys %h;   # prints 'one two three'

      $h{four} = 4;  # key 'one' is removed, 'four' is added

      print join ' ', keys %h;   # prints 'two three four'

ABSTRACT
    Hashes tied to Tie::IxHash::FixedSize will only hold a fixed maximum
    number of keys before automatically removing old keys.

DESCRIPTION
    Hashes tied with Tie::IxHash::FixedSize behave exactly like normal
    Tie::IxHash hashes, except the maximum number of keys that can be held
    by the hash is limited by a specified "size". Once the number of keys in
    the hash exceeds this size, the oldest keys in the hash will
    automatically be removed.

    The "size" parameter to "tie()" specifies the maximum number of keys
    that the hash can hold. When the hash exceeds this number of keys, the
    first entries in the hash will automatically be removed until the number
    of keys in the hash does not exceed the size parameter. If no size
    parameter is given, then the hash will behave exactly like a plan
    Tie::IxHash, and the number of keys will not be limited.
